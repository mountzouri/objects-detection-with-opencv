# Objects Detection in video with OpenCV
This video was created for the Master of Artificial Intelligence, KU Leuven. It is related to a school project of the Master Course entitled: Computer Vision.
It contains techniques for grabbing an object by first finding features that capture properties of the object and then use these features to detect it. 
Image processing techniques are applied to an one minute video, frame by frame, using Python code and OpenCV library. 

## Overview

The techniques applied to process the video are the following:
* Sobel Edge Detector to detect horizontal and vertical edges
* Canny Edge Detector
* Hough Transform to detect circular objects of varying shape
* SIFT feature descriptor method for detecting an object of arbitrary shape (draw a ï¬‚ashy rectangle around it)
* Detect this object under different circumstances ( various orientations, rotation, move the object around in the video) 

## Processing
